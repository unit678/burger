# burger

A burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM. 
Add a burger you'd love to eat, then eat it! Keeps track of burgers you want 
to devour, and burgers you have already devoured.
Follows the MVC design pattern and uses Node and MySQL to query and route data in the app, 
with Handlebars to generate the HTML.
